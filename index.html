		  <div class="concept-description">
			  <p> 
    html is what forms the web. It contains <b>text</b> (what you see) and <b>markup</b> (what determines how it looks)
			   html is formed by codes and <b>elements</b> which will tell the browser how to read a page.

  TAGS // use and meaning
   </div>
   <div class= "concept-description">
   		<p><b>tags</b> are how a computer and a browser will read information the way we want it. Each tag means something else and is always enclosed by the tag signs.
		Most of the times we must place a tag at the beginning and close it at the end of the element you want to affect.
   </p>
     <p> 
     some examples of tags are:
      <br><em>
      b = bold
      em = italic
      a = anchors or links
      br = break
      p = paragraph</em>
     </p>
       <p>
         we don't need to remember all these tags, they are easily found online in websites like
        </p>
      <a href="http://www.w3schools.com"> this one </a>
     
      <p>
       In order to incorporate links, images or video elements into our HTML, different tags and formulas
must be used. Find some examples <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_a.asp"> here</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        some tags such as <em> break</em> or <em> paragraph</em > might have similar effects on content and text since
        they both separate sentences bringing them to a different level. The difference is that the first one is called <u>inline</u> 
        while the last one is referred to as <u>block.</u>
       </p>

  	<div class= "concept-title">
  INLINE VS BLOCK // difference
  </div>
   <div class= "concept-description">
     <em><br>inline= breaks the text into a separate <b>line</b></em>
    <em> block= breaks the text into a sort of <b>box</b> that can have a specific width and height</em>
    <p>
    These are the basic elements, but a complete HTML would include a <em>doctype, html, head, title, body</em> and it will look something like <a href=http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_doctype.asp> this</a>

		    <h2>LESSON 2 - The Structure of HTML</h2>
   </div>
        <div class="concept-title"> HTML BOXES// basic structure
        </div>
        <div class="concept-description">
       
  <p>
  To design the structure of a basic HTML we must think in terms of <b>boxes</b>. All elements are inside boxes which will be classified by <u>div</u> tags. There can be boxes inside other boxes, which is called the <b> tree-like</b> structure</p>
        </div>
      <div class="concept-title">
        CLASSES AND ATTRIBUTES // what are they?
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
      <p>In structure of our website and how many boxes we want, we can then <u>style</u> them in terms of size, color and location
      </p>
      <p>Classes serve as <u>labels</u> to better organize our boxes. We can put a class on each dive to better explain if it belongs to an image, content, text, etc
      </p>
      </div>
      <div class="concept-title">
      WRITING CODE// how and where
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
      <p>There are different options of <u>text editors</u> we can use to write code depending on our level of knowledge and needs. Some of the ones recommended are <b>Sublime, codepen or scratchpad</b> 
      </p>
      <p>When looking at a website in a browser like Google Chrome, we can always take a look at the <b>developer tools</b> to spy the code and style used for thats pecific site, it is a great way to learn and understand code</p>

		    <h2>LESSON 3 - CSS style sheets</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="concept-title">
          AVOID REPETITION// simplifying style
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p><b>Avoiding repetition</b> is important in order to reduce the probability of errors when writing code, as well as when making changes in the future. CSS is used as a way to simplify the styling of a web page by using <b> divs and classes </b> and writing specific characteristics we want for each of those (font style, size, location, color, etc).
        CSS stands for <u>Cascading Style Sheets </u> and lets us avoid repetition. We can give a certain style to a certain <b> class</b> and once we <u> link </u> our CSS to the HTML, the changes will be applied to all elements that carry that same class name.</p>
        <p>In this particular website, for example, I gave the same style to every <b>LESSON</b> by assigning each lesson a same <b>div and class</b>. I then specify the style I wanted for that particular div and class on my CSS and that did the trick! If I would copy/paste the style attribute for each lesson instead, I would have more margin of error and more possibilities of making mistakes when adding and changing elements.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="concept-title">
          LINKING CSS// different ways 
        
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p> Although there are different ways to use CSS on an HTML, it is recommended to write the CSS code on a sparate document, save it on the same folder as the HTML and then link them together with a specific line of code. This method will avoid confusion, and it is cleaner for others to read and understand.</p>

          PROGRAMMING // languages and interpreters
     </div>
  <div class="concept-description">
    <p> The computer is a machine that can be <b>programmed</b> to do almost anything. There are different <b>languages</b> that can be used to tell a computer what do to. Unlike english, spanish or any other laguages we can learn, programming languages are more precise. Computers use <b>interpreters</b> to understand the laguage, but interpreters can't distinguish "incorrect" code, we must write precise and correct language in order for the code to run properly.</p>

          PYTHON // grammar and expressions
  </div>
  <div class="concept-description">
      <p> In this lesson, we got to understand a bit one of the programming languages called <b>PYTHON</b> and <u>Python Interpreter</u> which is used to follow the instructions on the code we write.
        <b>Python Grammar</b> is based on formulas formed by series of what we call <b>expressions</b></p>
    <p> 
      An example of a Python grammar is: <em>expression--->Expression Operator Expression</em>
    </p>
    
    <p>In this example, we can write a combination of one expression followed by one operator and another expression.  <b>Expressions and Operators</b> can be replaced by different elements such as:</p>
    
    <p>
       <p><em>Expression--->numbers</em></p>
       <p><em>Operator--->+</em></p>
       <p><em>Operator--->*</em></p>
       <p><em>Number--->0,1,2, ...</em></p>
   
  <p>Taking this example we could write something like: <em> print 2 * 5 + 3 * 6</em>
  </p>
    <p>For a clear explanation of how Python expressions work, check this <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud552-nd/l-3527838955/e-48704311/m-48736065"> video </a>
